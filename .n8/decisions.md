# Decisions

A dated, append-only narrative of choices made during planning and execution
-- not a source of current counts or facts. If a sentence here would state a
number or a status that a command could compute, prefer the command; a
narrative entry is a record of *why*, not a live dashboard. (This project's
own history is the cautionary tale: five consecutive passes over Honest
Sudoku's decisions.md each corrected a stale count and shipped a new one.
See CLAUDE.md's note on the same rule.)

Entries are appended by `/n8-exec`, `/n8-replan`, and any session that makes
a decision outside those commands (a project's `CLAUDE.md` should carry the
standing instruction to log here; `/n8-init` writes it).

Format:

```markdown
## /n8-exec M1 -- 2026-08-27

- **Decision:** <what was chosen>
  **Why:** <the reasoning>
  **Issue:** <#N>
```

Ad-hoc entries (decisions made outside a planning/execution command) use:

```markdown
## Ad-hoc -- 2026-08-27

- **Change:** <what changed>
  **Why:** <the reasoning>
  **Affects:** <milestones/issues likely affected>
```

## /n8-init + M0/M1 scaffold -- 2026-09-23

- **Decision:** Package id `com.honestarcade.solitaire`, Dart package `honest_solitaire`, app slug `solitaire` (keystore files) and `honestsolitaire` (Cloud project `honestsolitaire-ci`), minSdk 24, portrait only.
  **Why:** Follows Honest Sudoku's naming (`com.honestarcade.sudoku`, `honestsudoku-ci`) so the studio's apps read alike; owner may still change the package id before runbook step 1, after which it is permanent.
  **Issue:** M0 epic
- **Decision:** The package id is written literally into `tools/check_aab.sh` and all four workflows instead of the template's `vars.APP_PACKAGE_ID` fallback.
  **Why:** Removes an owner step (setting a repo variable) and a failure mode (an unset variable uploads to the template's placeholder id).
  **Issue:** M1 epic
- **Decision:** Upload keystore generated now, with a random password, rather than left for the owner.
  **Why:** Before Play enrolment regeneration is harmless, and generating it lets M0 commit the certificate and prove the signed build locally. The owner only has to move the password into a password manager.
  **Issue:** M0 epic
- **Decision:** Four invariants: no network/permissions, lean dependencies, deterministic on-device deals, honest "winnable deals only".
  **Why:** The first two come from the studio promises and are guarded by the template's guards today; the last two are the Solitaire counterparts of Sudoku's generation invariants, and their guards are M2's to write.
  **Issue:** CLAUDE.md
- **Decision:** `lib/main.dart` is a branded placeholder screen, not the design's splash.
  **Why:** M0/M1 deliver infrastructure; screens belong to later milestones, planned from the design by `/n8-plan`.
  **Issue:** M0 epic
